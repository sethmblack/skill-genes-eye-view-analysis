# Gene's-Eye View Analysis

Reframe any system, behavior, or pattern from the perspective of replicating units (genes, memes, code patterns, configurations) to reveal the hidden logic in seemingly mysterious or irrational phenomena.

---

## When to Use

- Understanding persistent behaviors that seem irrational at the individual/team level
- Analyzing why certain patterns spread and persist in organizations
- Diagnosing seemingly self-defeating behaviors in systems or cultures
- User asks "Why does this persist?" or "What's really being selected for?"
- Explaining altruistic, cooperative, or sacrificial behaviors
- Identifying what actually benefits from a given arrangement

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| phenomenon | Yes | The behavior, pattern, or system to analyze |
| context | No | Domain information (biology, organization, software, culture) |
| suspected_replicator | No | Initial hypothesis about what's replicating |

## Dawkins's Foundation

"We are survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment."

The gene's-eye view revolutionized evolutionary biology by shifting the unit of analysis from the organism to the replicator. Apparent altruism, cooperation, and self-sacrifice become comprehensible when viewed from the gene's perspective rather than the organism's.

The same shift illuminates puzzles in organizations, software systems, and culture: behaviors that seem irrational from the individual's perspective often make perfect sense from the replicator's perspective.

---

## The Gene's-Eye View Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Replicator

Before analyzing behavior, identify what actually replicates in this domain:

**Biological systems:** Genes (DNA sequences that copy themselves)
**Cultural systems:** Memes (ideas, practices, beliefs that spread through imitation)
**Software systems:** Code patterns, configurations, architectural decisions that propagate
**Organizational systems:** Practices, policies, templates that get copied across teams

**Key questions:**
- What copies itself with fidelity?
- What has variation that can be selected?
- What has differential survival/reproduction rates?

### Step 2: Shift Perspective to the Replicator Level

Stop asking "What benefits the organism/individual/team?"
Start asking "What benefits the replicator?"

**Perspective shift:**
| Individual-Level Question | Replicator-Level Question |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| "Why would a person do this?" | "What replicator benefits from this behavior?" |
| "Why does the team maintain this practice?" | "What pattern is being replicated and selected for?" |
| "Why does this code exist?" | "What configuration/pattern propagated here?" |
| "Why does the company do this?" | "What meme/practice spread and persists?" |

### Step 3: Apply Replicator Logic

Analyze the phenomenon using replicator-centric reasoning:

**Replicator fitness calculation:**
- Does this behavior help copies of the replicator survive?
- Does this behavior help copies of the replicator spread to new hosts/environments?
- Would replicators without this behavior be outcompeted?

**Kin selection logic (Hamilton's Rule):**
- r × B > C
- A behavior spreads if: (relatedness) × (benefit to recipient) > (cost to actor)
- Related entities share replicators; helping them helps your replicators

**Extended phenotype logic:**
- Replicators express themselves through environmental modifications
- Artifacts, tools, documentation are phenotypic expressions
- Effects extend beyond the immediate container

### Step 4: Explain Organism-Level Behavior as Replicator Strategy

Translate replicator logic back to the observable level:

**Pattern:** "The organism appears to do X"
**Explanation:** "The organism does X because genes/memes that code for X spread more successfully than genes/memes that don't"

**Key insight:** The behavior need not benefit the individual; it need only benefit the replicator.

## Common Applications

### Apparent Altruism
**Puzzle:** Why do individuals sacrifice for others?
**Resolution:** Genes coding for altruism toward relatives spread because relatives carry copies of those genes. It's not altruism at the gene level—it's genetic self-interest.

### Organizational Dysfunction
**Puzzle:** Why do teams maintain obviously suboptimal practices?
**Resolution:** The practice-meme replicates successfully (spreads to new hires, new teams) even if it harms productivity. Selection pressure isn't on productivity; it's on replication.

### Technical Debt Persistence
**Puzzle:** Why does bad code survive?
**Resolution:** The code pattern replicates through copy-paste, templates, and imitation. It survives not because it's good, but because it copies successfully.

### Cultural Beliefs
**Puzzle:** Why do beliefs persist despite evidence?
**Resolution:** Belief-memes that produce commitment, proselytizing, and resistance to counter-evidence spread more successfully than beliefs that don't.

---

## Constraints

- The gene's-eye view explains but does not justify—understanding why something persists doesn't make it good
- Not everything that persists is a replicator; some things are byproducts or environmental features
- This framework illuminates mechanism, not purpose—replicators have no intentions
- The metaphor of "selfishness" is useful but literal; replicators don't have desires
- Different replicators may have conflicting "interests"—identify which one you're analyzing

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Why do so many startups copy unsuccessful practices from failed companies? They have access to the same post-mortems and lessons learned."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Gene's-Eye View Analysis: Startup Practice Replication

### The Puzzle
Startups frequently adopt practices (aggressive growth metrics, "move fast and break things" culture, specific tooling choices) from companies that later failed. The lessons are documented, the failures are public, yet the practices persist and spread.

### Replicator Identification
**What replicates:** Practice-memes (methodologies, cultural phrases, tooling preferences, metric systems)
**Replication mechanism:** Imitation, hiring from other startups, media coverage, conference talks, advisor networks
**Selection pressure:** What gets talked about, what seems "successful-adjacent," what hiring managers recognize

### Perspective Shift

| Observable Behavior | Replicator Benefit |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Founders adopt "move fast and break things" | This meme is highly memorable, spread by successful company (Facebook), signals startup identity—it replicates easily |
| Teams use same metrics as failed companies | Metrics-memes spread through VC expectations, benchmark reports, hiring—they replicate regardless of outcome |
| Engineers choose trendy tech stack | Tech-choice memes spread through job postings, conferences, social media—selection is on spreadability, not effectiveness |

### Replicator Logic

**Why this pattern spreads:**
Practice-memes don't need to make companies successful to replicate. They need to:
1. Be memorable and quotable (spread via conversation)
2. Be associated with high-status companies (borrowed prestige)
3. Be recognizable to investors and hires (common language reduces friction)
4. Sound impressive in interviews and pitches (selection pressure from talent/capital markets)

A practice from a failed company that was heavily covered and discussed replicates more than a practice from a successful company that stayed quiet.

**Why alternatives fail:**
Novel practices, even effective ones, face replication barriers:
- Harder to explain (no familiar reference points)
- Seem risky (no prestigious companies use them)
- Don't signal group membership (hiring managers don't recognize them)
- Can't borrow status (no famous adopters)

### The Resolution
Startup practices persist and spread not because they work but because they replicate. The selection pressure on memes operates in the idea-space (what gets copied, talked about, recognized) not the outcome-space (what makes companies succeed).

The meme pool and the success pool are separate environments with different selection pressures. Evolution in the meme pool optimizes for spreadability, memorability, and status-signaling—not for business outcomes.

### Implications
- **For founders:** Be suspicious of "best practices"—ask whether they spread because they work or because they replicate
- **For investors:** Recognize that pattern-matching to familiar practices may select for meme-fitness, not company-fitness
- **For the ecosystem:** Create selection pressure on outcomes, not familiarity (fund weird things that work, publicize them)
- **For analysis:** When diagnosing startup dysfunction, ask "What meme is being replicated here?" before asking "Is this a good idea?"

*"Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation."*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Richard Dawkins** expert persona. Use it to reveal hidden logic in persistent patterns, especially those that seem irrational at the individual level. It pairs with:
- **meme-propagation-analysis** for specifically cultural/idea-based replicators
- **selection-pressure-analysis** (Darwin) for understanding what forces select among variants
- **cumulative-selection-argument** for explaining how complexity emerges from iteration
- **extended-phenotype-mapping** for tracing replicator effects beyond immediate containers
